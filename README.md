# Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections committee has asked for our team to do an election audit on the Congressional election in 3 counties: Arapahoe, Denver and Jefferson.  The items for us to review and analyze, are as follows:

1. Total # of Votes cast.
2. Complete list of Candidates who received votes.
3. Total # of votes each candidate received.
4. Percentage of votes each Candidate received/won.
5. The winner, based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.7, Visual Studio Code, 1.71.2

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows there were 369,711 Ballots Tallied
3 Candidates were involved:   
 1. Diane DeGette (272,892 votes received)
 2. Charles Casper Stockham (85,213 votes received)
 3. Raymon Anthony Doane (11,606 votes received)
 
The Winner of the Election was Diane DeGette with 73.8% of the votes, while Charles Casper Stockham had 23.0% of the votes, and Raymon Anthony Doane with only 3.1% of the votes.

## Challenge Overview
This Challenge was the most fun so far, however going into the week I could not determine I would finish.  This was very hard, there is so much information and language that stayed the same, such as conditions, variables, IF statements.  There is so much language in data analysis it's seems very fast-paced and hard to grasp all the concepts we are learning.  I do enjoy when the code works in VSCode and Terminal, however I found that to be so rare.  I followed all the steps in the Module to complete the challenge and my code still came out as Raymon Anthony Doan as the winner.  I reviewed my code for hours and changed the tenses, caps, variables, checked all my spacing, indentions.  I could not figure out how to get Diane as the winner, or how to print in the text boxes, and that may not have worked just due to the code not being correct. Even though this class is very difficult and extremely time consuming, I will do my best to retain what I'm learning hoping it will start to click and make more sense.

## Challenge Summary
To summarize this module, I am hoping I can figure out where I went wrong in my coding.  It was extremely time consuming, and I cannot spend another second looking at this computer.
